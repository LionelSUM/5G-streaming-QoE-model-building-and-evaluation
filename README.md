With the rapid advancement of 5G technology, video streaming services have emerged as 
the primary content in 5G networks, posing significant challenges in enhancing video 
transmission performance and ensuring optimal user experience (QoE). Through a detailed 
analysis of the characteristics of 5G networks and the impact of video streaming transmission, 
we select and define QoE evaluation metrics suitable for 5G scenarios, like video bitrate, chunk 
duration, etc. This study aims to investigate the Quality of Experience (QoE) for video 
streaming over 5G networks through simulation and modeling techniques. To address the QoE 
modeling issue in a 5G video streaming application scenario, this experiment conducts 
simulation experiments to validate and establish an effective QoE model using appropriate 
indicators. Initially, relevant indicators are selected based on the specific application scenario 
of the QoE model, followed by data processing on these chosen indicators. Subsequently, 
machine learning modeling methods are employed to develop a comprehensive QoE model by 
integrating these selected indicators. Finally, validation of the obtained QoE model is 
performed using RMSE validation and P-value validation on simulation software to assess its 
validity and usability. Additionally, a physical experimental platform for simulating 5G video 
streaming scenarios is established to further verify the effectiveness and applicability of the 
proposed QoE model derived from simulations. The novelty of this experiment lies in 
integrating various QoS scoring metrics as reference indicators while utilizing supplementary 
indicators derived from other models and algorithms for enhanced accuracy in QoE modeling.
